This project is for maintaining details  (specially salary)  of employees working in a company.

The database will contain employeeâ€™s name, age, department, salary (we can add more details if necessary)

We can add new employee to our database, show every record in the database and do some basic query on the database. This project can be extended by adding some more features.
So I used react and mongodb database. To to get this project going we need react installed and any working environment like vs code or sublime text etc.
We also need to install react-router-dom,axios, mongoose,cors,antd. All of them can be installed by simple command. Ex: 
    npm I react-router-dom
